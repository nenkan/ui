## Contributing

Contributions to this project are welcome.

If you want to help, only start working on an issue after having been assigned to it. That way we can ensure no more than one person is working on the same issue at the same time. 

We ask that you test the code in your local environment to make sure it actually works. We encourage you take the time to understand the codebase. If not sure about it, just ask and someone will gladly help you.

## Development

Then, open a terminal window and run the following commands.

Install the dependencies:

## Production

Pushes to the default branch automatically trigger an action to build and deploy the storybook to the production website.
